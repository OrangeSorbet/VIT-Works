Honestly, man. I was a music major in college over 25 years ago. 2 years of theory under my belt, 2 years of ear training, some conducting and a few other things. I was mainly a woodwind player. Clarinet was my primary instrument. In my peak days I was 1st chair, concert master, solo's, yada yada and so on, but life happens and it took me in a different direction. I went into computer tech / software as a backup. I've missed music for so long and I'm about to finally start getting back into it again with synths and music production in Ableton. Mostly as a hobby with no expectations and purely for the enjoyment of it. You've helped me to reignite a spark I had for over half my life (from age 12 to 30) that I had to give up for a while. I just want to say I appreciate your passion for music. It's really is inspiring...and honestly, you teach theory better than some college that I've had, lol.  Thank you for what you do and keep up the amazing work.
