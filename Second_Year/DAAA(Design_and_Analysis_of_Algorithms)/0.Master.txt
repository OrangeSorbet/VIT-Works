i) Write algorithm steps (pseudocode)
ii) Implement in C++
iii) Perform a priori analysis
iv) Measure execution time for different input sizes (posterior analysis)
v) Analyze time and space complexity

2. Implement Binary Search on a sorted array.
Tasks:
i) Recursive and iterative implementations
ii) Count number of comparisons
iii) Compare best, worst, and average cases

3. Implement Merge Sort using divide and conquer technique.
Tasks:
i) Recursive divide and merge steps
ii) Trace recursion tree
iii) Analyze time and space complexity

4. Implement Quick Sort and compare with Merge Sort.
