Finding Maximum and Minimum in an Array

---

1. Problem

Design and implement an algorithm to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array.

---

2. Algorithm (Pseudocode)

Algorithm FindMinMax(A, n)

Input: Array A of size n
Output: Minimum and Maximum element

Step 1: If n <= 0
Print "Array is empty"
Stop

Step 2: Set min = A[0]
Step 3: Set max = A[0]

Step 4: For i = 1 to n - 1
If A[i] < min
min = A[i]
If A[i] > max
max = A[i]

Step 5: Print min and max
Step 6: End

3. A Priori Analysis

The algorithm scans the array once.

For each element there are at most two comparisons:
One comparison with the current minimum
One comparison with the current maximum

Worst case comparisons = 2(n - 1)
Best case comparisons = n - 1

Number of operations increases linearly with n.

4. Posterior Analysis

Execution time observed for different input sizes:

Input size 1000
Execution time small

Input size 10000
Execution time larger than for 1000

Input size 100000
Execution time larger than for 10000

Execution time increases proportionally with input size.

5. Time Complexity

Best Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n)
Average Case: O(n)

6. Space Complexity

Space required for array = O(n)
Extra space for min and max variables = O(1)

Total Space Complexity = O(n)
